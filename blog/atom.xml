    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people say that if you do something for at least three consecutive weeks, it becomes a habit. Although it might sound a bit superficial, I think it has some truth to it… After six weeks of GSoC, I noticed that I have made a daily habit of checking what is happening in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python"&gt;pvlib GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, which could mean anything from checking the discussions to code contributions!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So GSoC goes on strong, and almost one month has passed since the start of the coding period! I have to admit that I feel much more comfortable with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the structure of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python"&gt;pvlib&lt;/a&gt;, which really makes a difference in progressing with my GSoC tasks. Of course, the main reason is the incredible amount of help I have received from my mentors &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AdamRJensen"&gt;Adam R. Jensen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kandersolar"&gt;Kevin Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, but also from my fellow GSoC students &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/echedey-ls"&gt;Echedey Luis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RDaxini"&gt;Rajiv Daxini&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, my GSoC experience proves just how strong the open science community is and how willing people are to assist even newbie programmers who have many questions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the coding period officially started on May 27th, and the first two weeks of GSoC have already passed! As with everything new, the introduction to GiHub and open-source coding has been a bit challenging, but luckily, the mentors were here to help whenever I got stuck! I feel like I learned so many things these past two weeks that I have a bit of a hard time organizing my thoughts in a post that makes sense… But I will give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;
