# About me

My name is Ioannis, and Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where I work on modeling and assessing solar energy systems and energy storage.

Part of the reason I'm writing this blog is my participation in the Google Summer Of Code, where I plan to contribute functions for calculating cell temperature and ambient conditions for floating PV systems to the open-source PV simulation software [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/). I sincerely believe that open-source science is the future of research, as it provides a great way to disseminate knowledge and enhance result reproducibility. For this reason, I have created the [PitStorages](https://github.com/PitStorages) repository on GitHub, which provides Python scripts and operation data for analyzing the operation of large-scale thermal energy storage systems. Additionally, I have been contributing to developing the website [SolarStations.org](https://SolarStations.org), which provides an overview of high-quality solar radiation monitoring stations worldwide, including metadata.
